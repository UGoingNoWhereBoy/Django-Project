## No Bootstrap or any framework was used to come up with this result except for django ofc.


## this project is made while i was learning django and getting better at css and html and javascript so the code might be a bit of a mass.
## Im still pretty new to django and backend or programming as a whole so you may find bugs and errors you can help with fixing them but as far as i tested it its working without any issue.
